                The <b>Row</b> and <b>column</b> grouping feature is used to create a cross-tabular format. The report is
                designed with
                single row group and column group, each has a parent and child group.
            </li>

                Sorting is applied to row groups to sort the product category and sub-category in descending and ascending
                orders. More information about sorting data in matrix groups can be found in this <a href="https://help.boldreports.com/enterprise-reporting/designer-guide/report-designer/report-items/tablix/sort-data-in-tablix-data-region/#set-sort-expression-on-a-tablix-group"
